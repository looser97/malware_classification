# Abstract
The  explosive  growth  of  malware  variants  posesa  major  threat  to  information  security.  Traditional  anti-virus systems based on signatures fail to classify unknown malware intotheir corresponding families and to detect new kinds of malwareprograms.In  this  paper  a  comparative  analysis  is  done  on  twoapproaches  that  can  be  used  for  this  classification  on  a  dataset provided   by   Microsoft   in   ”Microsoft   Malware   Classification Challenge (BIG 2015)”. First approach is using grey scale imagesthat  are  formed  by  reading  the  assembly  file  of  malwares  asbinary  file  and  converting  that  binary  file  to  grey  scale  image  .We apply a CNN model on these images for classifying them indifferent classes of malwares . Second approach is based to textclassification using the assembly files of malwares and extractingfeatures  like  count  vector  and  n-gram.We  built  a  Deep  Neural Network  model  on  these  features  for  classification.

# Results
For exact comparison the same dataset for all the 3 modelsis used and a train-test split of 0.2 for all.The criteria used forcomparison is the accuracy score.
* The CNN model built for classification based on the grey-scale images gave an accuracy of 81.7%.
* The  Deep  Neural  Network  with  count  Vector  as  featuregave an accuracy of 80.6%.
* The  Deep  Neural  Network  with  count  Vector  as  featuregave an accuracy of 87.03%
